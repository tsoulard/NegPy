"""ETTR auto-calibration unit tests.

Fake linear sensor: Signal = k · level · true_seconds, no bias (rawpy removes it → black = 0). It
meters the ladder's true exposure, like a real body — NOT the rounded label, which is a display
name ("1/3" exposes 0.315 s).
Only the lit channel gets signal (one LED on per probe, as on the real rig). `k_scale` scales all
three uniformly, like opening the aperture; per-channel k models the deep-red weakness (R lowest).
