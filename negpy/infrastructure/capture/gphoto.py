"""Camera capture through libgphoto2 — one session, no proprietary SDK, no helper binary.

`GphotoCamera` is both the capture device (the `Camera` protocol) and the live-view
source: libgphoto2 keeps a single PTP session per body, so previews, property writes and
stills all ride the same handle behind one lock. It writes the preview JPEG and a
settings JSON to the same paths the previous helper used, so the UI polls them unchanged.

Five behaviours of the library shape this module; each is guarded below:

* Reading a value off a choice widget that has **no** choices dereferences a NULL and
  kills the process with SIGSEGV — no `except` can catch it. See `_safe_value`.
* Property writes are asynchronous. The body needs ~1-2 s before it reports a new value
  back, so a write is confirmed by polling, never assumed. See `_set_verified`.
* After a still, the event queue must be drained or the *next* capture fails with a bare
  `[-1] unspecified error`. See `_drain_events`; after a successful still it runs on a
  small worker so the wait overlaps the next channel's LED settle (`_finish_shot_async`).
* Choice strings are run through gettext, so on a German desktop `focusmode` reads
  'Manuell'. The message locale is pinned before the library loads. See `_pin_locale`.
* A downloaded shot must also be *deleted* off the body. Bodies without a capture-target
  setting (Fujifilm) keep every tethered object and refuse further captures once their
  buffer fills — the X-T5 dies at exactly shot #13, ~1 GB. See the delete in `capture`.

Vendors name the same control differently and expose different subsets of it, so every
property is looked up rather than assumed — see `_PROPERTIES` and `_MAGNIFIERS`. Only Sony
bodies have been tested.
