"""Roll membership: a Roll is a named, navigable group of frames -- either a real
library folder recognized as a roll, or a virtual roll built by hand from whatever the
Film Strip currently holds (a search result, a hand-picked selection, extras added to a
folder roll that are not physically in that folder).

Edits are not stored here and are not scoped by roll by default: they stay in the edits
DB under each frame's own content hash, exactly as if no Roll existed. A Roll only
decides which files show up when you open it -- with two exceptions. A path a user has
explicitly forked (``forked_paths``) gets its own edit identity for that roll alone,
suffixed onto the frame's content hash (``roll_edit_hash``), the same convention
half-frame scans already use for their two halves. And roll-wide defaults, below, hold
a handful of film, rig and scanning facts that describe the roll rather than one
frame's own look.
