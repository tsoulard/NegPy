"""The library is the filesystem: roots are folders on disk, and a search is a walk.

There is no index database. An index would have to be kept true against a tree the
user reorganizes outside NegPy, and it would buy less than it looks: the metadata
worth searching lives in the edits (joined by path, see
``StorageRepository.load_settings_by_path``), not in the files, so a walk only has to
supply name, path and date — which ``os.stat`` already gives it. A walk cannot go
stale, needs no reindex action and no cache to clear.

ponytail: the per-session walk cache below is the whole optimization. If a real
archive ever measures slow on the first search, the upgrade is a path-keyed table of
these same stat rows — not a different search.
