"""One-time lock for fields that became roll defaults after frames already carried their
own value: White/Black Point and their per-layer trims (Normalization), and Highlight
Recovery (Raw Decode). No roll has a default for them yet, so a frame's own value still
renders; the first Roll push would overwrite it on every frame that is not locked. This
locks the card on each frame whose saved value differs from the default, in every roll
that holds it. Best-effort and idempotent: guarded by a done flag, and it never raises
into app startup.
