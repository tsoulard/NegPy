"""Per-channel ETTR exposure auto-calibration for RGB narrowband film scanning.

The film base is metered inside a user ROI and each of R/G/B is exposed just below clipping
("expose to the right"). The key idea is a **linear model**:

    Signal_c = k_c · Level_c · t

where `k_c` (the channel response) is *measured*, never assumed, so any sensor (Sony, Fuji
X-Trans, …) is handled automatically. With one **shared** shutter `t` and three per-channel LED
levels there are 4 knobs and 3 targets, leaving one degree of freedom (the shutter). It is fixed
uniquely by putting the **dimmest** channel near PWM_MAX_SAFE (fastest shutter + highest levels at
once — no quality/speed trade-off; the gap to PWM_MAX is the verify trim's headroom). Everything
is then solved in one shot instead of searched.

A single-capture preset lights R, G and B together for one exposure, so each sensor channel also
reads the neighboring LEDs:

    Signal_c = t · Σ_j M_cj · Level_j

`M` is measured one LED at a time, like `k`, and the levels come from solving that system for one
target on all three channels. The highest level takes the place of the dimmest channel in the
shutter pick.

Two representations of a shutter coexist deliberately. Labels are rounded display names for a
geometric ladder ("1/3" exposes 0.315 s, not 0.333 s): ordering/snapping read the label literally
(`shutter_seconds`), anything multiplied into the physics uses the rung's true time
(`true_seconds`). The model above only holds in the second representation.

No dark frame: rawpy already subtracts the sensor bias, so `black = 0` (and the injected demosaic
must scale by the camera's white level, never per-frame — see `linear_demosaic`). An exposure
target that is unreachable at the hardware limits raises `CalibrationExposureError` ("over"/
"under", carrying the aperture advice) as early as the probe can prove it — a preset that misses
its target is worthless, so none is saved (rig decision). Hardware-free: light, camera and a
`demosaic` callable are injected.
